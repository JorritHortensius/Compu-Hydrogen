# Compu-Hydrogen
Code and report of Monte Carlo simulations on Hydrogen molecule

The repository contains four files with code

The two important files are:  
1. VMC_hydrogen  
   Contains the code which we used to calculate energies of the    
   hydrogen molecule with the Variantional Monte Carlo Method  
2. DMC_hydrogen   
   contains the code which we used to calculate energies of the  
   hydrogen molecule with the Diffusion Monte Carlo Method 

Two less important files:  
3. VMC_HO_Helium  
   We used this code to practice the VMC on simple systems, namely the  
   1D Harmonic Oscillator and the Helium atom.  
4. DMC_HO  
   We used this code to practice the DMC method on the simple  
   1D Harmonic oscillator.
