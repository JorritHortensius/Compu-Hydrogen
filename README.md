# Compu-Hydrogen
Code and report of Monte Carlo simulations on Hydrogen molecule

The repository contains four files

The two important files are:__   
1. Variatonal_Monte_Carlo__
   Contains the code which we used to calculate energies of the__  
   hydrogen molecule with the Variantional Monte Carlo Method__
2. Diffusion_monte_carlo__
   contains the code which we used to calculate energies of the__
   hydrogen molecule with the Diffusion Monte Carlo Method 

Two less important files: \\
3. VMC_HO_Helium \\
   We used this code to practice the VMC on simple systems, namely the \\
   1D Harmonic Oscillator and the Helium atom. \\
4. DMC_HO \\
   We used this code to practice the DMC method on the simple \\
   1D Harmonic oscillator. \\
